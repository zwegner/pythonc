Pythonc--Python to C++ translator

Copyright 2011 Zach Wegner

Pythonc is pronounced like "Pie Thonk", for obvious reasons.

It currently translates some nontrivial subset of Python code into C++. No
claims are made about the correctness or efficiency of the generated code.
In particular, there is no garbage collection whatsoever.
You have been warned.

The translator is released under the GPLv3.

The C++ backend, used by the generated code, is released under the Apache license.
